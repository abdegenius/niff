// ── policy_id assignment ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// policy_id is a u32 scoped per holder: the contract increments a per-holder
// counter stored at DataKey::PolicyCounter(holder).  This means two holders
// can each have policy_id = 1 without collision; the canonical key is always
// (holder, policy_id).  A single holder may hold multiple active policies
// simultaneously; each active policy grants exactly one vote in claim
// governance (one-policy-one-vote, not one-holder-one-vote).
